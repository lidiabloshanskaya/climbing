Description of the data source for the ClimbMagic project. 

I scraped the basic data for the routes (around 140Mb as of now) from https://www.mountainproject.com/ - the database/community for climbers and climbing routes. The data involves around 136k routes with the info on climber's rating, difficulty grade name of climb and text with description of climbs.
